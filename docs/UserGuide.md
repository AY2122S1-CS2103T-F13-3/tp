## Introduction

**Tuition Address Book (TAB)** is an all-in-one desktop application that helps you keep track of the large number of students and their respective lesson information, and empower you to provide the best quality home tuition service.

TAB comes with a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) while optimised for user interaction via a CLI (Command Line Interface).
With TAB, you can effortlessly manage your students' contact details faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

## About This Guide

This user guide is intended for any user of TAB. It provides installation instructions to help get you started with using TAB, and describes in detail the features available in TAB.

**Navigation**

In the [Table of Contents](), each item listed is a link which you can click on to go directly to that section in the guide.

**Conventions Used**

* `text` : denotes a command to be entered into the command box in TAB.
* <kbd>text</kbd> : denotes a keyboard input, or a button to be clicked on.
* [text](#about-this-guide) : denotes links to other parts of the document, or links to be opened in the browser.


## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **Java 11** or above installed on your computer.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: JDK Installation Guide**

You can install the required JDK and JRE from the 
[Java SE Development Kit Downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

to help you with the installation. Follow the guide for your operation system for detailed instructions.
</div>

2. Download the latest **TAB.jar** from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAB.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The window similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all students.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to TAB.

   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all students.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
  
* Items in curly brackets separated by the pipe character `|` indicates that you must select exactly one parameter from the list of choices.
  e.g. `cond/{all | any | none}` can be used as `cond/all` or `cond/any` or `cond/none`.
  
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the `add` command:**<br>

* At least one contact field is required.<br>
  e.g. at least one of the `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `e/EMAIL`, `pp/PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER`, or `pe/PARENT_EMAIL` fields must be 
  included in the add command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the `edit` command:**<br>

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed list of students.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2` means that you wish to edit the 2nd student in the displayed list.

* You must provide at least one field.<br>
  e.g. entering just `edit 2` alone is not a valid command. You need to include the field you wish to edit.

* Existing values will be updated to the entered values.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 f/0` will override the outstanding fees of the 2nd student in the displayed list to `0`.

* When editing tags, all existing tags of the student will be removed and replaced with the tags specified.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 t/SEC2 t/IP` will erase the student's original tags and replace it with the new tags `SEC2` and `IP`.

* You can delete the data in optional fields by supplying a parameter with no arguments.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 r/` will remove the remarks for the 2nd student in the displayed list.

* You cannot remove a contact field if it is the only remaining means of contact you have with a student.<br>
  e.g. no student should have all contact fields empty. `edit 2 pp/` will not work if the student does not have
  any `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, or `PARENT_EMAIL`.

* You can delete all tags of a student by typing `t/` without any arguments.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 t/` will remove all existing tags from the 2nd student in the displayed list.

</div>

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

### Finding Students

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Finding students by fields: `find`

Finds all students whose fields match the given keyword(s), based on the specified find condition.

Format: `find [cond/{all | any | none}] [n/NAME_KEYWORDS] [a/ADDRESS_KEYWORDS] [p/PHONE_KEYWORDS] [e/EMAIL_KEYWORDS] [pp/PARENT_PHONE_KEYWORDS] [pe/PARENT_EMAIL_KEYWORDS] [sch/SCHOOL_KEYWORDS] [stream/ACAD_STREAM_KEYWORDS] [lvl/ACAD_LEVEL_KEYWORDS] [t/TAG_KEYWORD]…​`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the `find` command:**<br>

* You can find students by all the fields except remark and fee.

* The filter condition indicates that a student is only considered a match when `all`, `any` or `none`
  of the fields which you are searching for match the student.<br>
  e.g. 
    * `find n/John t/math cond/all` will return students with both the name `John` and the tag `math`.
    * `find n/John t/math cond/any` will return students with only the name `John`, or only the tag `math`, or both.
    * `find n/John t/math cond/none` will return students without the name `John` and the tag `math`.

* The filter condition will not accept other arguments besides `all`, `any` and `none`.<br>
  e.g. `cond/every` will result in an error.
  
* The filter condition is optional and defaults to `all` if not specified.

* The filter condition is case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. `None` or `ANY` are valid.
  
* You must provide at least one field to search.<br>
  e.g. entering just `find` or `find cond/any` alone is not a valid command. You need to include the fields you wish to search for.

* You must provide at least one keyword to search for.<br>
  e.g. entering just `find n/ ` alone is not a valid command as the keyword is empty.

* Tags must only have one keyword.<br>
  e.g. `find t/zoom math` is invalid. To search by multiple tags, you can do `find t/zoom t/math`.
  
* The search is case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. keyword `hans` will match `Hans`.

* A keyword can match a word partially.<br>
  e.g. keyword `math` will match `mathematics`.
  
* The order of the keywords do not matter.<br>
  e.g. keyword `west jurong` will match `jurong west`.
  
* A field needs to contain all specified keywords to be matched.<br>
  e.g. keywords `Amad Ali` will not match `Amad` or `Ali Abdul`, but it will match `Amad bin Ali`.

</div>

Examples:
* `find a/west p/9876 n/john` matches student with name `Johnny tan`, address `Clementi west`, and phone number `98765432`.
* `find cond/none t/new t/paid t/zoom` returns students with none of the tags `new`, `paid` and `zoom`.
* `find stream/express sch/nus cond/any` returns students with stream `express` or school `nus`.
