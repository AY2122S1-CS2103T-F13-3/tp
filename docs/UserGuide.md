## Introduction

**Tuition Address Book (TAB)** is an all-in-one desktop application that helps you keep track of the large number of students and their respective lesson information, and empower you to provide the best quality home tuition service.

TAB is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application which allows users to interact with it with just text inputs. On top of that, TAB also 
comes with a clean and aesthetic Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing users to view their data easily.
With TAB, you can effortlessly manage your students' contact details faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features
This section describes the available features in TAB.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
  
* Items in curly brackets separated by the pipe character `|` indicates that you must select exactly one parameter from the list of choices.
  e.g. `cond/{all | any | none}` can be used as `cond/all` or `cond/any` or `cond/none`.
  
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
* There are constraints in place to determine whether the value you provided for a field is valid. 
  TAB will inform you if you gave an invalid input for a field.

#### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to TAB.

Format: `add n/NAME a/ADDRESS [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [pp/PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER] [pe/PARENT_EMAIL] [sch/SCHOOL] [stream/ACAD_STREAM] [lvl/ACAD_LEVEL] [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A student can have any number of tags (including 0).
</div>

* At least one contact field is required.<br>
  e.g. at least one of the `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `e/EMAIL`, `pp/PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER`, or `pe/PARENT_EMAIL` fields must be 
  included in the add command.
* `lvl/ACADEMIC_LEVEL` field allows only a maximum of 15 characters (including spaces).

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 pp/92345678 pe/jackdoe@example.com sch/John's School stream/John stream lvl/J1`

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. <br>
  e.g. `edit 2` means that you wish to edit the 2nd student in the displayed list.

* You must provide at least one field.<br>
  e.g. entering just `edit 2` alone is not a valid command. You need to include the field you wish to edit.

* Existing values will be updated to the entered values.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 f/0` will override the outstanding fees of the 2nd student in the displayed list to `0`.

* When editing tags, all existing tags of the student will be removed and replaced with the tags specified.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 t/SEC2 t/IP` will erase the student's original tags and replace it with the new tags `SEC2` and `IP`.

* You can delete the data in optional fields by supplying a parameter with no arguments.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 r/` will remove the remarks for the 2nd student in the displayed list.

* You cannot remove a contact field if it is the only remaining means of contact you have with a student.<br>
  e.g. no student should have all contact fields empty. `edit 2 pp/` will not work if the student does not have
  any `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, or `PARENT_EMAIL`.

* You can delete all tags of a student by typing `t/` without any arguments.<br>
  e.g. `edit 2 t/` will remove all existing tags from the 2nd student in the displayed list.

Format: `list`

Shortcut: <kbd>F2</kbd>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding Students
This section guides you on how to find or filter students of your choice in TAB.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Finding students by fields: `find`

Finds all students whose fields match the given keyword(s), based on the specified find condition.

Fields that you can search for are:

Field            | Parameter                   | Result                                              
------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
Student Name     | n/NAME_KEYWORDS             | Students whose name contains all the keywords
Student Address  | a/ADDRESS_KEYWORDS          | Students whose address contains all the keywords
Student Phone    | p/PHONE_KEYWORDS            | Students whose phone number contains all the keywords
Student Email    | e/EMAIL_KEYWORDS            | Students whose email contains all the keywords
Parent Phone     | pp/PARENT_PHONE_KEYWORDS    | Students whose parent phone number contains all the keywords
Parent Email     | pe/PARENT_EMAIL_KEYWORDS    | Students whose parent email contains all the keywords
School           | sch/SCHOOL_KEYWORDS         | Students whose school contains all the keywords

Academic Level   | lvl/ACAD_LEVEL_KEYWORDS     | Students whose academic level contains all the keywords
Remarks          | r/REMARK_KEYWORDS               | Students whose remarks contains all the keywords
Tags             | t/TAG                           | Students who have the specified tag
Lesson Subject   | subject/LESSON_SUBJECT_KEYWORDS | Students who have lessons with subject that contains all the keywords
Lesson Date      | date/LESSON_DATE | Students with lessons that fall on the specified date
Lesson Time      | time/LESSON_TIME | Students with lessons that fall in the specified time range
Cancelled Dates  | cancel/CANCELLED_DATE     | Students who have lessons cancelled on the specified date
Lesson Rates     | rate/LESSON_RATE_KEYWORDS | Students whose lessons have rates that contain the keyword
Lesson Homework  | hw/LESSON_HOMEWORK_KEYWORDS | Students who have homework that contains all the keywords

Format: `find [cond/{all | any | none}] [n/NAME_KEYWORDS] [a/ADDRESS_KEYWORDS] [p/PHONE_KEYWORDS] [e/EMAIL_KEYWORDS] [pp/PARENT_PHONE_KEYWORDS] [pe/PARENT_EMAIL_KEYWORDS] [sch/SCHOOL_KEYWORDS] [stream/ACAD_STREAM_KEYWORDS] [lvl/ACAD_LEVEL_KEYWORDS] [r/REMARK_KEYWORDS] [t/TAG_KEYWORD]…​ [subject/LESSON_SUBJECT_KEYWORDS] [time/LESSON_TIME] [date/LESSON_DATE] [cancel/CANCELLED_DATE] [rates/LESSON_RATE_KEYWORDS] [hw/LESSON_HOMEWORK_KEYWORDS]`

Notes about the find condition:

* The find condition indicates that a student is only considered a match when `all`, `any` or `none`
  of the fields which you are searching for match the student.<br>
  e.g. 
    * `find n/John t/math cond/all` will return students with both the name `John` and the tag `math`.
    * `find n/John t/math cond/any` will return students with only the name `John`, or only the tag `math`, or both.
    * `find n/John t/math cond/none` will return students without the name `John` and the tag `math`.
    
* The find condition is optional and defaults to `all` if not specified. <br>
  e.g. `find date/10 Oct 2021 time/1000-1400` will return students with lessons that occur between `1000-1400` on `10 Oct 2021`.
  
Notes about search keywords:

* You must provide at least one field to search.<br>
  e.g. entering just `find` or `find cond/any` alone is not a valid command. You need to include the fields you wish to search for.

* You must provide at least one keyword to search for.<br>
  e.g. entering just `find n/` alone is not a valid command as the keyword is empty.

* Tags must only have one keyword.<br>
  e.g. `find t/zoom math` is invalid. To search by multiple tags, you can do `find t/zoom t/math`.
  
* The search is case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. keyword `hans` will match `Hans`.

* A keyword can match a word partially.<br>
  e.g. keyword `math` will match `mathematics`.
  
* The order of the keywords do not matter.<br>
  e.g. keyword `west jurong` will match `jurong west`.
  
* A field needs to contain all specified keywords to be matched.<br>
  e.g. keywords `Amad Ali` will not match `Amad` or `Ali Abdul`, but it will match `Amad bin Ali`.

Examples:

To find a student, you may enter `find a/serangoon n/Bern` into the command box.

All students in TAB whose address matches `serangoon` and whose name matches `Bern` will be returned. The figure below shows the list after the find command is executed.

![findAll](images/findAll.png)
<div class="caption">TAB displays one student after the find command.</div>

To find students without the `unpaid` tag and whose school is not `NYJC`, you may enter the command `find cond/none t/unpaid sch/NYJC`. The figure below shows the list after this find command is executed.

![findNone](images/findNone.png)
<div class="caption">TAB displays three students after the find command.</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Managing Lessons

This section guides you on how to use the commands for managing the lessons of your students in TAB.
A lesson **must** have the following fields: a start date, a time range, a lesson rate and a subject.

A lesson can be categorised into 2 types: 
1. A **weekly** recurring lesson
2. A one-off makeup lesson.

The essential fields for a lesson are:
* Start date
* Time range
* Subject
* Rate

An optional field for both types of lesson is:
* Homework
* Outstanding Fees (refer to more details in this [section](#managing-lesson-fees))

Optional fields for a **recurring** lesson is:
* End date
* Cancelled dates

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* The lesson's rate refers to the fee of the lesson per hour.
This rate will be used in the calculation of fees due after each lesson.

* A lesson can be identified by the index number shown in the lesson list of the student.
</div>

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Adding a lesson: `ladd`

Adds a lesson to the specified student in TAB.

Format: `ladd INDEX [recurring/[END_DATE]] date/dd MMM yyyy time/HHmm-HHmm subject/SUBJECT rates/LESSON_RATES [hw/HOMEWORK]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can add multiple pieces of homework to a lesson in TAB.
</div>

* The type of lesson will be inferred from the presence of the `recurring/` prefix.

* The end date for the recurrence is optional.
  
* The date is case-insensitive. i.e. `12 jaN 2022` is equivalent to `12 JAN 2022`.

Examples:

* `ladd 1 recurring/23 Nov 2022 date/30 jan 2022 time/0900-1100 subject/Math rates/37.50` adds a recurring lesson that
starts on 30 Jan 2022 and ends on 23 Nov 2022 to the 1st student in the displayed student list.

<div class="caption">Reminder window interface.</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Managing Lesson Fees

This section guides you on how to use the commands for managing the lesson fees of your students in TAB and the behaviour of the Fees Calculator feature of TAB.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* Outstanding fees can only be added and edited using Lesson Commands.
* Outstanding fee displayed in Student details is the sum of all the student's lesson's outstanding fees.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Adding a Lesson's Outstanding Fees : `ladd`

Adds outstanding fees to specific lesson. Uses the Lesson Add command as seen in [Adding a lesson](#adding-a-lesson-ladd).

In the event that you have existing outstanding fees for the lesson prior to adding the lesson, you can add outstanding fees as a field when adding lesson.
Outstanding fee is an optional field and if not added with lesson, TAB will assume outstanding fees for the newly added lesson as $0.00.

Format: `ladd 1 COMPULSORY_FIELDS f/OUTSTANDING_AMOUNT`

Examples:

* `ladd 1 recurring/23 Nov 2022 date/30 jan 2022 time/0900-1100 subject/Math rates/37.50` adds the recurring lesson with the specified details and outstanding fees is assumed to be `$0.00`.

* `ladd 1 recurring/ date/30 jan 2022 time/0900-1100 subject/Math rates/37.50 f/250`
  adds the recurring lesson with an outstanding fee of `$250.00`.

#### Editing a Lesson's Outstanding Fees: `ledit`

Edits the outstanding fees to specific lesson. Uses the Lesson Edit command as seen in [Editing a lesson](#editing-a-lesson--ledit).

In the event that you disagree with the outcomes of the Fees Calculator, you can edit outstanding fees using `ledit` command.
Refer to [Behaviours of the Fees Calculator](#behaviours-of-the-fees-calculator) for cases the Fees Calculator will not account for.

Format: `ledit INDEX LESSON_INDEX OTHER_FIElDS_TO_EDIT f/OUTSTANDING_AMOUNT`

Examples:
* `ledit 2 1 f/250` Edits the outstanding fees to `$100.00`.
* `ledit 1 1 time/1100-1200 f/100` Edits the time range to `1100-1200` and outstanding fees to `$100.00`.
* `ledit 1 1 rates/50 f/0` Edits the rates to be `$50.00` and outstanding fees to be `$0.00`.

#### Paying a Lesson's Outstanding Fees: `paid`

Pays for a specific lesson.

The amount paid would be deducted from the outstanding fees field. The amount paid should be greater than 0 and should not be greater than the current outstanding fees.

Format: `paid INDEX LESSON_INDEX amt/AMOUNT_PAID`

Examples:
* `paid 1 1 amt/70` The 1st student has paid `$70.00` for his or her 1st lesson.
* `paid 3 2 amt/480.50` The 3rd student has paid `$480.50` for his or her 2nd lesson.

#### Behaviours of the Fees Calculator

TAB will update your lesson's outstanding fees upon launching TAB after the lesson has ended using Fees Calculator feature. Fees will not be updated while TAB is open, it will only update fees upon launch.
The Fees Calculator will account for cancelled dates and ensure that lesson fees on these dates will not be added.

However, the Fees Calculator will not account for any changes to lessons that have passed. Such cases include:

* **Lesson rates increment.** In the event that you want to increase your lesson rates, the current outstanding fees will not change according to the newly edited lesson rates.
* **Incorrect lesson rates entry.** Similarly, in the event that you have entered your lesson rates incorrectly and only realised it after your lesson has passed, the current outstanding fees will not change according to 
the newly edited lesson rates.
* **Cancelling or uncancelling a date in the past.** In the event that you did not cancel your lesson and the fees for that particular cancelled lesson has been added to outstanding fees, the Fees Calculator will not deduct
the fees of the cancelled lesson for you. Same for uncancelling a lesson that has passed, the fees will not be added back for you.
* **Shifting the end date of a recurring lesson.** In the event that the end date of the lesson is shifted to an earlier date and lessons after that new end date have already passed, the outstanding fees will not change.
* **Shifting the start date of a recurring lesson.** In the event that the start date of the lesson is shifted to an earlier date and lessons between the edited start date and original start date have passed,
the fees of these lessons will not be deducted for you. Same for shifting start date to a later date after the original start date has passed and fees have been updated prior.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Viewing your Calendar

This section guides you on how to use TAB's calendar interface. Typing any of the commands in this section will bring you to the calendar interface. Any other command, such as `list` or `tag`, will bring you right out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Switching to the calendar interface: `calendar`

Brings you to TAB's calendar interface for you to see all your scheduled lessons.
