### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The *Architecture Diagram* given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of the components and how they interact with each other.

**Key components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for the following:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. In particular, the `LogsCenter` class plays an important role in the high-level design of the App as it is used to write log messages to the App's log file, which will be helpful for tracing and debugging.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`Ui`**](#ui-component): Handles the _UI_ of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Executes the user's commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory while the App is running.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk. Allows the user to save and load data.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below is an example of how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above)

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### Ui component

The *API* of this component is specified in the [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java) interface.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The `Ui` component uses the JavaFX framework and consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CenterPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible _GUI_.

The layout of these _UI_ parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `Ui` component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the _UI_ can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, as it relies on `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Calendar` objects residing in the `Model`.
* chooses which component it displays based on the `CommandResult` returned by `Logic` component after executing the user command (e.g., `CommandResult#isShowSchedule()` tells the `Ui` to display the user's schedule. See also: [Schedule feature](#schedule-feature)). 

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) *class diagram* of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses, e.g., `AddCommand`) which is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The _Sequence Diagram_ below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` _API_ call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />


The `Model` component

* stores the tuition address book data, i.e., all `Person` and calendar `Entry` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object and `CalendarEntryList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate filtered list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed', e.g., the `Ui` component can be bound to this list so that it automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Schedule feature

Users can view a calendar that contains all existing lessons to visualise their schedule and plan ahead.

#### Current Implementation

TAB uses the [CalendarFX](https://dlsc.com/products/calendarfx/) library to implement its schedule view.
Each lesson stored in the `Model` component is also converted to a CalendarFX `Entry` and maintained in the `CalendarEntryList` of `AddressBook`. 
The `Ui` component shows this list of entries in the `SchedulePanel` using CalendarFX's `DetailedWeekView`.

The following code snippet shows how `SchedulePanel` is initialised from the `Model` component's `Calendar`.

```java
public class SchedulePanel extends UiPart<Region> {

    private static final String FXML = "SchedulePanel.fxml"; // The corresponding .fxml file for this UiPart

    private final DetailedWeekView calendarView;

    // other fields...
    
    /**
     * Creates a {@code SchedulePanel} with the given {@code Calendar}.
     */
    public SchedulePanel(Calendar calendar) {
        super(FXML);
        calendarView = new DetailedWeekView();
        initialiseCalendar(calendar);
        createTimeThread(); // Starts a thread to keep track of the current time
    }

    /**
     * Sets up CalendarFX.
     */
    public void initialiseCalendar(Calendar calendar) {
        CalendarSource calendarSource = new CalendarSource();
        calendarSource.getCalendars().addAll(calendar);
        calendarView.getCalendarSources().addAll(calendarSource);
        
        calendarView.setStartTime(TimeRange.DAY_START);
        calendarView.setEndTime(TimeRange.DAY_END);
        // other settings...
        
    }
    
    // other methods...
}
```
When `SchedulePanel` is initialised, it sets up a `DetailedWeekView` with our custom display settings, and a thread that allows us to display the current time on the calendar interface. The way we initialise the calendar is adapted from CalendarFX's [Quick Start Guide](https://dlsc.com/wp-content/html/calendarfx/manual.html#_quick_start).

Any changes made to the `Calendar` in `Model` will automatically update the `DetailedWeekView` in the `SchedulePanel` through CalendarFX's internal implementation (see how in the [manual](http://dlsc.com/wp-content/html/calendarfx/manual.html)). 

#### CenterPanel

We allow the user to toggle between viewing the schedule and viewing the list of students with the `CenterPanel` class in the `Ui` component.

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the `Ui` components interact with each other when user inputs the `schedule` command.

![Interactions Inside the Ui Component for the `schedule` Command](images/ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

When the user requests to view the schedule,the `displaySchedulePanel()` method of `CenterPanel` is called, which sets the current display to show the `SchedulePanel`.
Switching back is similarly achieved by calling the `displayPersonListPanel()` method of `CenterPanel`.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How schedule is implemented:**

* **Alternative 1:**  Create a calendar view using JavaFX.
    * Pros: More customisable as we are not limited by CalendarFX's API.
    * Cons: Much more difficult to implement.

* **Alternative 2 (current implementation):** Use CalendarFX to display entries while storing entry data locally.
    * Pros: Less code is written to implement it and the difficulty of implementing a calendar is completely abstracted away.
    * Cons: There is the initial difficulty in picking up and learning CalendarFX's API, and a risk that it might not work out the way we want it to. We will also be limited to the features of CalendarFX, and any bug or issues will be inevitably find its way into our system as well.

We chose alternative 2 and integrated CalendarFX into our app as the possibility of introducing bugs seems small due to it being a well-used and well-tested library. Furthermore, the schedule feature will be much more robust and can be implemented much faster as compared with alternative 1.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Lesson Management

#### Current Implementation

Lessons refer to the recurring or makeup lessons added by the user to TAB. These lessons can be added to any particular
in TAB. Added lessons can also be edited and deleted.

**_[Coming soon]_** Chosen dates of recurring lessons can be marked as cancelled. User will be able to specify an end date to their recurring
lessons to be able to add another recurring lessons in the same timeslot without having to delete the previous one. This is
for the sake of keeping records of past lessons.

A `Lesson` is represented in the application as shown in the figure below. It contains a start `Date`, a `TimeRange` for the
`Lesson`, a `Subject` and `Homework` fields. There are 2 types of `Lesson` â€“ `RecurringLesson` and `MakeUpLesson`. `RecurringLesson`
represents a **weekly** recurring lesson. `MakeUpLesson` represents a one-off lesson outside the regular schedule.

![LessonClassDiagram](images/LessonClassDiagram.png)

The model checks for clashing lessons to ensure that TAB does not contain any duplicate `Lesson` objects as well as `Lesson`
objects with overlapping time ranges.

Operations on lessons can be done using the `LessonAddCommand`, `LessonEditCommand` and `LessonDeleteCommand` commands.
The class diagram given below shows how these commands are part of the `Logic` Component.

![LessonLogicDiagram](images/LessonLogic.png)

These commands are described in greater detail in the sections below.

#### Adding Lessons
The `LessonAddCommand` adds a lesson to the list of lessons of a student in TAB.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram for adding a lesson to a student.

![LessonAddSequenceDiagram](images/LessonAddSequenceDiagram.png)

The following snippet shows how the `LessonAddCommand#executeUndoableCommand()` method updates the `Lesson` objects in 
the `Person` in the `UniquePersonList`by adding `toAdd` to the list of lessons the student currently has. Note that `toAdd`
will not be added if there is an existing lesson with a clashing date and timeslot.

```java
public class LessonAddCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        List<Person> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_STUDENT_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }
        if (model.hasClashingLesson(toAdd)) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_CLASHING_LESSON);
        }
        personBeforeLessonAdd = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
        personAfterLessonAdd = createEditedPerson(personBeforeLessonAdd, toAdd);

        model.setPerson(personBeforeLessonAdd, personAfterLessonAdd);
        
        // ... display updated TAB and command result message
    }
}
```

The lesson added will be displayed in the `LessonListPanel` in TAB.

#### Editing Lessons
The `LessonEditCommand` edits the lesson identified by its index in the displayed list of lessons with respect to the student
with this lesson. The lesson will be edited per the given information input by the user.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram for editing a lesson.

![LessonEditSequenceDiagram](images/LessonEditSequenceDiagram.png)

In the `LessonEditCommand` class, a new class called `EditLessonDescriptor` is defined to create `Lesson` objects that will store
the new values for the fields that have been specified to be edited. The `createEditedLesson()` method uses the `EditLessonDescriptor`
object to create the `editedLesson` object.

The `executeUndoableCommand()` method of the `LessonEditCommand` uses this `editedLesson` object to update the `model` of TAB.
The new lesson is stored in TAB in place of the old lesson. The student's list of lessons will be updated to reflect 
the changes made to the specified lesson.

#### Deleting Lessons
The `LessonDeleteCommand` deletes the lesson specified by its lesson index in the displayed list of lessons with respect to the 
student with this lesson. 

The figure below shows the sequence diagram for deleting a lesson.

![LessonDeleteSequenceDiagram](images/LessonDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

The specified `Lesson` object will be deleted from the `model` of TAB, and the updated list of lessons of the student will be displayed.

#### Storing Lessons
The set of `Lesson` objects are stored within the `Person` who is referencing these `Lesson` objects. The `JsonAdaptedLesson` is used
to convert the `Lesson` objects to Jackson-friendly `JsonAdaptedLesson` objects that can be stored in the `.json` file, where all the 
`Person` objects in TAB is stored. When the application starts up, this class is also used to convert the `JsonAdaptedLesson` objects
into `model`-friendly `Lesson` objects.

#### Displaying Lessons in GUI
A single `Lesson` is displayed using a `LessonCard`. All `Lesson` objects belonging to a student is displayed in a list using
the `LessonListPanel`, which contains a `ListView` of multiple `LessonCard`s.
The list of lessons is displayed side by side the list of students. The `ViewCommand` is used to specify which student's
list of lessons to view.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Data Structures to support lesson operations**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the `Lesson` objects in a set referenced by a `Person` object.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Operations have to be done with respect to the `Person` with the set containing the target lesson.

* **Alternative 2:** Store a `UniqueLessonList` containing the lessons of all the students in TAB.
    * Pros: No need to edit `Person` for `Lesson` operations.
    * Cons: Operations are done with respect to the full list of lessons in the application, which means user cannot
    isolate the list of lessons of a student of choice to operate on.

### Viewing Tags
Viewing tag is facilitated by `UniqueTagList`. 
- `UniqueTagList` stores a list of alphabetically sorted unique unmodifiable tags with case-insensitive tag names.
- `UniqueTagList` holds a class field `tagCounter` that maps `Tag` to `Integer`, where `Integer` is the number of persons labelled under each tag. 
- `Tag` objects are not referenced by `Person`, i.e. each `Person` has a set of `Tag` objects.

Operations include:
- `UniqueTagList#asUnmodifiableTagList()` - Returns an unmodifiable view of the tag list.
- `UniqueTagList#addTagFromPersonList(List<Person>)` - Adds tags from the specified list of persons to the tag list.
- `UniqueTagList#addTagFromPerson(Person)` - Adds tags from the specified person to the tag list if the tags do not exist in the tag list. If there is already a tag with same case-insensitive name, it increments the `Integer` that this tag is mapped to in `tagCounter`.
- `UniqueTagList#removeTagFromPerson(Person)` - Removes tags belonging to the specified person from the tag list if there is no person labelled under this tag after removal, else, decrements the `Integer` that this tag is mapped to in `tagCounter`.
- `UniqueTagList#editTagFromPerson(Person)` - Removes the original tags belonging to the specified person to the tag list and adds the new tags labelled for the specified person.
- `UniqueTagList#getNumStudentsForTag(Tag)` - Returns the number of students labelled under the specified tag as stored in `tagCounter`.
These operations are called when a person is added, deleted, or edited with `AddCommand`, `EditCommand` and `DeleteCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how viewing tag is executed:
- **Step 1:** The user launches the application. The `Model` is initialized with the saved data (or sample data if there is no saved data). Tags from each person is loaded into `UniqueTagList` and `tagCounter` with corresponding number of students labelled with the tags.
- **Step 2:** The user enter the command `tag` to view all tags. `AddressBookParser` parses this command, creating a `TagCommand`.
- **Step 3:** `LogicManager` executes the `TagCommand`. 
  - During execution, `TagCommand#execute()` calls `Model#getObservableList()` to get the tag list with the tags created in TAB with their corresponding number of students labelled under them to be displayed to the user.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Tags with duplicate case-insensitive tag names for a person is not allowed. If the user tries to adds a tag with the same tag name to the person already with that tag, the new tag will not be added and `tagCounter` will not increment the count for this tag.<br>

Figure T1 shows a sequence diagram of how viewing tags works.<br>
<img src="images/ViewTagSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

#### Design considerations:
**Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Use a `UniqueTagList` to store the tags created and a class field `tagCounter` to map each unique `Tag` to the number of persons labelled under it.
- Pros:
  - Quicker retrieval and update of data using a `HashMap` for `tagCounter`.
- Cons:
  - Each `Person` object has its own set of `Tags` which may be repetitive and memory-consuming if there is a large number of same tags.
  - Retrieval of all tags and calculation of the number of persons labelled under each tag during the initialization of the application requires iterating through all persons in TAB.

**Alternative 2:** Each tag stores a list of persons or number of persons labelled with that tag.
- Pros:
  - Faster retrieval of the number of persons under each tag.
- Cons:
  - This could result in circular dependency since a `Person` keeps reference of a set of `Tags` and a `Tag` has to keep a reference to a list of `Persons` simultaneously.
  - Updating the tags labelled for a `Person` requires modification of the data fields of the `Person`. Since TAB objects are immutable, this means that new copies of `Person` and `Tag` have to be created after every command that modifies the data. This could slow down the application when there is a large amount of data stored.
    
### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_


### Finding students

The `FindCommand` allows users to find students based on person fields.

**Current Implementation**

The figure below shows the sequence diagram for finding students.

![Find Command](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)


The user can specify multiple fields to search for and each field takes in multiple keywords.
An exception is the tag field which only accepts a single keyword. Instead, users can specify multiple tag fields.

The `PersonMatchesKeywordsPredicate` is used to test whether a person matches the specified keywords.
For each searchable field, a predicate is created which tests if a given person's field contains all specified keywords.

Additionally, a `FindCondition` can be specified by the user which determines whether `all`, `any` or `none` of the fields specified are required to match with a given person, for the person to be returned. The default is `all`.

The `PersonMatchesKeywordsPredicate#test()` method will compose all searched field predicates into a single predicate, depending on the find condition.
The predicate is then used to filter the list of person.


**Design considerations:**

**Aspect: Data structure of predicates**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a single `PersonMatchesKeywordsPredicate` class to represent all fields' predicates.
    * Pros: All predicates meant for testing on person fields can be consolidated in one place and reduce code duplication. It can also encapsulate the composition of all predicates.
    * Cons: If fields have different matching behaviour, it may result in the class having more than one responsibility.
* **Alternative 2:** Use multiple `{field}MatchesKeywordsPredicate` classes to represent each field's predicate.
    * Pros: It offers greater flexibility for each field predicate to have its own matching behavior.
    * Cons: There is greater probability of bugs introduced if a new field to search is to be added, or if the matching behaviour of all predicates are required to be changed.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

A private 1-to-1 home tuition teacher in Singapore that:

1. has a need to manage not more than 50 student contacts
2. has a need to manage admin details of each student, namely, lesson fees and payment
3. has a need to keep track of lesson details for each student
4. teaches lessons anytime between 8am and 10pm (UTC+8), on any day of the week
5. has a need to manage a busy schedule of not more than 50 lessons
6. prefers desktop apps over other types
7. can type fast
8. prefers typing to mouse interactions
9. is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
10. tutors students belonging to Singaporeâ€™s education system

**Value proposition**: TAB is an all-in-one app that manages work schedule and client relationships faster than 
a typical mouse/_GUI_ driven app. TAB effortlessly keeps track of large amounts of necessary 
student and lesson information, to empower tutors to provide the best quality home tuition service.  


### User stories

We categorise our user stories into three main epics:
1. [S] - Keeping track of student information
2. [L] - Keeping track of lesson information
3. [U] - Having a simple, efficient, and intuitive _UI/UX_

Priorities: High - must have; Medium - nice to have;  Low - unlikely to have.

### Glossary

* **Academic level**: Mainstream academic years from primary to tertiary education in Singapore (i.e. Primary 1-6, Secondary 1-5, Junior College 1-2 and Year 1-6).
* **Academic stream**: Mainstream tracks in Singapore (i.e. Express, NA, NT, IP, IB) as well as other common exam streams (e.g. IELTS, SAT, ACT).
* **Class Diagram**: UML class diagrams describe the structure (but not the behavior) of an _OOP_ solution. These are possibly the most often used diagrams in the industry and are an indispensable tool for an OO programmer (as defined in the Software Engineering for Self-Directed Learners CS2103/T edition [textbook](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/index.html)).
* **GUI**: Graphical User Interface - a type of user interface through which users interact with the app via visual representations.
* **Makeup lesson**: A lesson that occurs only once, for a student who has missed a previous lesson.
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X.
* **OOP**: Object-Oriented Programming - a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others.
* **Recurring lesson**: A lesson that will occur more than once in patterned intervals.
* **Sequence Diagram**: A UML sequence diagram models the interactions between various entities in a system, in a specific scenario. Modelling such scenarios is useful, for example, to verify the design of the internal interactions is able to provide the expected outcomes (as defined in the Software Engineering for Self-Directed Learners CS2103/T edition [textbook](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/index.html)).
* **Session**: A session begins when the app is started and ends when the app is exited.
* **UI**: User Interface - the means by which the user and the app interact.
* **UML**: Unified Modeling Language - a modeling language that software engineers use to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.
* **UTC+8**: The UTC offset used by Singapore Standard Time (SST), 8 hours ahead of UTC. Historically also referred to as GMT+8.
  UTC, or Coordinated Universal Time, is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.
* **UX**: User Experience - The experience a user has when using the app.
