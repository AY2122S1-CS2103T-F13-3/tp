### Project: TuitionAddressBook (TAB)

Tuition Address Book (TAB) is an all-in-one desktop application for 1-to-1 private home tutors that helps to keep track of their students and their respective lesson information Everything on TAB can be done without ever leaving the keyboard! and empower tutors to provide the best quality home tuition service. TAB helps users manage studentsâ€™ contact details faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.



Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a tag command that allows users to view all existing tags in TAB.
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to view a list of all existing tags created for the students. The tag list also includes the number of students labelled with each tag.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as users can add different tags to the students for better organization.
  * Highlights: This feature complements the Find feature. Filtering by tags require users to input the exact tag name(s). If the user are unsure of the exact existing tag names, the user can first view the tag list then filter students by the tag names he/she is interested in. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives as there are many multiple ways of implementing this enhancement. The current design is chosen due to the balance between ease of implementation, efficiency as well as space allocation.

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
        * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
